## What is the goal of our project?


The goal of our project, **“Happiness Index Across Swiss Cantons,”** is to explore regional variations in quality of life across Switzerland through a multi-dimensional, data-driven lens. Our aim is not to define happiness with a single metric, but rather to let users interactively explore relevant socio-economic factors and derive their own insights.


## Where can I find this amazing website?

Our website is just a click away: [**“Happiness Index Across Swiss Cantons,”**](https://com-480-data-visualization.github.io/com-480-project-Ficciones/).


## Where can I find the data and code?

Our data is collected from [Swiss Federal Statistic Office](https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/statistics/regional-statistics/regional-portraits-key-figures/cantons.html). You can find the data we used in the folder [dataset](./dataset/), along with the script for data preprocessing.

Our frontend code is located in [this repository](https://github.com/avgstuBoboge/dv-frontend). You can find the setup guide to run the frontend there.
